# Predicting-Energy-Level-With-ML
Using ML model in scikit-learn library to predict HOMO and LUMO level of 3-fused rings molecule.

It takes typical 10-20 years of research and development to commercialize a new material. The fourth paradigm shift in science which is catalysing by data-driven discovery and machine learning (ML) are transforming the way we encounter with this problem. The energy levels of a given molecule are critical for various organic electronic applications. Hence, in this project, we aim to use ML to predict these energy levels, i.e. Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO), and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of three-fused rings molecule. Various ML models were applied using LUMO and HOMO as outputs, and coulomb matrices generated from the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILE) as inputs. A deeper analysis of the data indicated that the higher number of Nitrogen in the molecule the deeper energy levels and the smaller the band gap. These findings provide new intuitive insight related to the structures of molecules which could be useful in organic optoelectronics.
